# Retreat exercise

## Create a one-page website - INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Use **pair programming** - only one person is programming and the other one(s) is looking over their shoulder making suggestions, pointing out mistakes, or researching on the internet. After a while (20-30 minutes) switch your roles.

2. Create a new GitHub project called `retreat` and clone it to your `web` folder. We **DON'T expect you yet to know how to work in the same repository**. Hence, one person (=person 1) can create the project on their own Github, then work on it, when done, commit changes. Then, the second person goes to their Github (Github of person 1), downloads the zip file, works on it, when done commits changes. Then, a third person goes to Github (Github of person 2), downloads the zip file, works on it, when done commits changes. [Note: â€¦You could also fork the project, however, this might be a little more tricky and ask you to NOT get stuck on git, this is an exercise on the positioning!]

3. Set up a basic web page project with `index.html`, `style.css` and `img` and `fonts` folders for the images and fonts.

4. All necessary materials such as the visual design, images, color palette, and texts for the website are provided in repository. Keep in mind that one of the fonts is not a Google Font, so google around and then add the font to your project (hint: look above to Tips to Get Started and search for Self-hosted fonts).

### Hints and suggestions
1. Write a nice structured code, try to think **how BEM could help you**.
2. Be creative, google around, ask questions, **have fun.**
